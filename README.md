# Simple-Linear-Regression-Algorithm-ML
Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables - a dependent variable (also known as the response or outcome variable) and an independent variable (also known as the predictor variable).
In the context of machine learning and data analysis, simple linear regression is often used to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variable. For example, we might use simple linear regression to predict a person's salary based on their years of experience.
The basic idea behind simple linear regression is to find the line of best fit that represents the relationship between the two variables. This line is determined by calculating the slope and y-intercept of the line using a formula that minimizes the sum of the squared distances between the actual values of the dependent variable and the predicted values based on the independent variable.
The formula for simple linear regression is:
y = b0 + b1*x
where y is the dependent variable,
x is the independent variable,
b0 is the y-intercept, and b1 is the slope of the line.
To use simple linear regression in GitHub, you would typically use a programming language like Python or R to load your data, fit the regression model, and then make predictions based on the model. There are many libraries and packages available in both Python and R that make it easy to perform simple linear regression, including scikit-learn, statsmodels, and lm() in R.
